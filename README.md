# WORDLE


### User Story:
- No need to register
- As a player, I want to start Play and that will generate a new game;
- I want to type the letters on my keyboard and that will activate the words on the page keyboard;
- I have to guess the word by typing keys
- when I get a letter in the right place, turn the background color to green
- when I get a correct letter in the wrong place, turn the background to yellow.
- in the mean time, all used letters will change colors on the page keyboard: correct letters in the right place turn green, correct letters not in the right place: yellow. Wrong letters turn grey.
- I will have 6 chances.
- if I finish the game before my 6 chances, I will get a score (1-6) and will be able to share my score on twitter or facebook.
- if I use all 6 chances, a pop up will show: you lost and play again.
- every new game generates a new **random** word.
