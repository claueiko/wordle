## User story:

No registration required;

Game will load automatically and player can start typing answers straight away;

No need to use buttons, just the keyboard;

## How the game works:

The player will have to guess random 5 letter words generated by the computer;

Each letter and its position will be checked;

If the letter is correct and in the right position, the background color will turn green on that row; and green at the bottom keyboard;

If the letter is correct but not in the right position, the background will turn yellow on that row and at the bottom keyboard;

If the letter is not part of the word, they'll turn grey.

The player will have 6 tries.

When the player guesses the correct word, a popup message will come up saying "Congratulations".

If the player reaches all 6 attempts without guessing the word, a popup will show a "I'm sorry, you lost" message.

Both popups will have a restar button that will reload the page and generate a new word.


## Development process:

I started out with writing the html, then styling with CSS. I wanted to use divs only but later on found out it would be easier to use input fields for each letter.

Then I started working on JS with jQuery to access the input content, and match each letter from that input to the words I had added to my object.

Working on the logic was quite straightforward but I struggled a little with only moving the input field focus to the next row after the words on the previous row was checked.

Once I worked that out, I created popups to congratulate or not, the player.

After that was done, I styled my css and jQuery to add better styles and animation effects.
